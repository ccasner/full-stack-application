# Full Stack Project (Project 2)

## Development Process

```md
After working through the steps of building a resource on the back end, I worked on getting successful curl scripts to authenticate users. I then loaded the data for the tolls into the Toll resource so that it would be easily accessible to the user. In JavaScript, I wrote ajax calls that would allow the user to communicate with the API from the browser. After everything was working properly, I styled the webpage and deployed to GitHub pages and successfully connected to the API through the deployed Heroku site.

## Unsolved Problems
```md
Getting the third party API to deploy to heroku has not been figured out. It will only work on the localhost server.
```

## Plans For Future
```md
Add another feautre that adds charges by date so that monthly expense reporting is easier.
Add geolocation through Google Maps API so the app can track the user's location when using the app to be alerted when they are passing a toll area and record the charge to their personal resource.
Also add a directions feature so that users can map a trip and see how much the tolls will accumulate to.
```
